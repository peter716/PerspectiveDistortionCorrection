In this lab, I successfully performed perspective distortion correction. I learned the significance of generating high-quality processed coordinates—and their corresponding distortion coordinates—since these are crucial for accurately determining the H matrix. This matrix is essential for mapping distortion coordinates back to their original processed coordinates and vice versa. For these processed coordinates to be of high quality, they must form a perfect rectangle or square. Additionally, this experience enhanced my skills in array manipulation using Numpy.
